## About Me
I am a security-focused developer with a strong interest in **Blue Team operations** and **defensive cybersecurity**.  
My work mainly involves **Python scripting for security**, automation, and analysis of systems and networks.

I focus on understanding how attacks work in order to **detect, defend, and respond** effectively.  
I prefer building small, practical tools and learning through hands-on labs rather than copy-pasting solutions.
